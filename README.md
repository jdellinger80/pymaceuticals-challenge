Submit Your Final Analysis
Review all the figures and tables that you generated in this assignment. Write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of your notebook.

Capomulin seemed to shrink and debulk the tumors despite starting mass and size.. The data volume and quality for this drug was better than a number of the other regiments. Tumor size and mouse weight was strongly corelated in unexpected ways  


Background
You've just  joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. They have also asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
